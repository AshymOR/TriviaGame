var choice = 0


$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#optA').on('click', function() {
        choice = "a";
        
        $("#exampleModal").hide();
        
  
    });
  });



//get countdown timer working so every time the complex modal is shown it starts a 30 second countdown

//finish the click handlers to get the players answer and set it to choice
//get the other 9 questions set up


//if time runs out show the modal with the times up template
//Depending on what button is clicked set choice to either a, b, c, or d.
//If choice === the correct answer make the simple modal with the *unfinished* correct template show increase score by 1
//if choice !== the correct answer make the somple modal show with the incorrect template

//have the simple modal show for 5 seconds before hiding
//show complex modal with new question and answer options but using jquery to dynamically update the associated IDs

//once all 10 questions are answered bring up the simple modal that displays score, percentage and a picture that
//varies depending on what percent they got. Brackets being 0-59%, 60-79%, 80-99%, and 100%.

//I'm disapointed I was not able to ge this done.I am not exactly sure how I need to procceed to get it working the way I want
//it to. I'll be continuing to work on this during my free time and I'll be aking for help and tips.
